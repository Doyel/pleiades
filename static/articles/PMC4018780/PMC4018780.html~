                  <p class="first" id="d1e118">The spindle checkpoint delays exit from mitosis in cells with spindle defects. In
                     this paper, we show that Chk2 is required to delay anaphase onset when microtubules
                     are completely depolymerized but not in the presence of relatively few unattached
                     kinetochores. Mitotic exit in Chk2-deficient cells correlates with reduced levels
                     of Mps1 protein and increased Cdk1–tyrosine 15 inhibitory phosphorylation. Chk2 localizes
                     to kinetochores and is also required for Aurora B–serine 331 phosphorylation in nocodazole
                     or unperturbed early prometaphase. Serine 331 phosphorylation contributed to prometaphase
                     accumulation in nocodazole after partial Mps1 inhibition and was required for spindle
                     checkpoint establishment at the beginning of mitosis. In addition, expression of a
                     phosphomimetic S331E mutant Aurora B rescued chromosome alignment or segregation in
                     Chk2-deficient cells. We propose that Chk2 stabilizes Mps1 and phosphorylates Aurora
                     B–serine 331 to prevent mitotic exit when most kinetochores are unattached. These
                     results highlight mechanisms of an essential function of Chk2 in mitosis.

            <p id="d1e124">The spindle checkpoint delays exit from mitosis until all sister kinetochores attach
               to microtubules emanating from opposing spindle poles. The checkpoint signal is generated
               by kinetochores that lack attachment to spindle microtubules but also by lack of tension
               across attached sister kinetochores (
               <a href="#bib28">Nezi and Musacchio, 2009</a>; 
               <a href="#bib10">Foley and Kapoor, 2013</a>). Spindle checkpoint defects are associated with chromosomal instability, aneuploidy,
               and cancer predisposition (
               <a href="#bib10">Foley and Kapoor, 2013</a>).
               
            </p>
            <p id="d1e135">Components of the spindle checkpoint pathway include Mad1, Mad2, BubR1 (Mad3), Bub1,
               and Bub3 proteins. Recruitment of Mad and Bub proteins to unattached kinetochores
               is essential to prevent activation of the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C)
               and delay exit from mitosis (
               <a href="#bib28">Nezi and Musacchio, 2009</a>; 
               <a href="#bib10">Foley and Kapoor, 2013</a>). Activated APC/C is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that targets Cyclin B for degradation,
               leading to inactivation of Cdk1 and initiation of anaphase (
               <a href="#bib29">Peters, 2002</a>). However, in the presence of an active spindle checkpoint, human cells can “slip”
               through prolonged mitotic arrest via a slow but continuous degradation of Cyclin B
               that ultimately drives the cell out of mitosis (
               <a href="#bib4">Brito and Rieder, 2006</a>). Furthermore, in yeast,
               <span id="dd"> Cdk1 can be inactivated by inhibitory phosphorylation of Cdk1 on tyrosine 15 (Y15),
                  rather than by cyclin degradation (
                  <a href="#bib25">Minshull et al., 1996</a>), but whether this mechanism can operate in mammalian cells in the presence of a
                  fully functional APC/C is still unclear (
                  <a href="#bib4">Brito and Rieder, 2006</a>;

            <p id="d1e161">Mps1 kinase is essential for mitotic arrest and for localization of BubR1 and Mad2
               to unattached kinetochores (
               <a href="#bib1">Abrieu et al., 2001</a>). Mps1 enhances Aurora B kinase activity according to a certain study (
               <a href="#bib14">Jelluma et al., 2008</a>), and Aurora B activity is required for efficient recruitment of Mps1 to unattached
               kinetochores (
               <a href="#bib13">Hewitt et al., 2010</a>;

               <a href="#bib36">Saurin et al., 2011</a>). In addition, Mps1 and Aurora B jointly regulate correction of erroneous kinetochore–microtubule
               attachments (
               <a href="#bib30">Petsalaki and Zachos, 2013</a>).

            <p id="d1e185">Aurora B regulates chromosome alignment and segregation by promoting detachment of
               misattached microtubules (
               <a href="#bib43">van der Waal et al., 2012</a>). Aurora B is also involved in the spindle checkpoint; however, its precise role
               is a matter of active investigation (
               <a href="#bib43">van der Waal et al., 2012</a>). In higher eukaryotic cells, catalytic activity of Aurora B is required for sustained
               mitotic arrest in the absence of kinetochore tension (
               <a href="#bib8">Ditchfield et al., 2003</a>; 
               <a href="#bib17">Lampson and Kapoor, 2005</a>). Furthermore, recent studies have shown that potent inhibition of Aurora B activity
               weakens the mitotic arrest in the presence of many unattached kinetochores (
               <a href="#bib35">Santaguida et al., 2011</a>; 
               <a href="#bib36">Saurin et al., 2011</a>; 
               <a href="#bib23">Matson et al., 2012</a>). Aurora B localizes to centromeres from late prophase until metaphase, and a small
               population of active Aurora B is also found at kinetochores (
               <a href="#bib32">Posch et al., 2010</a>; 
               <a href="#bib31">Petsalaki et al., 2011</a>). Chk1 phosphorylates Aurora B–serine 331 (S331) to induce Aurora B kinase activity
               in “unperturbed” prometaphase (in the absence of spindle poisons) or after treatment
               of cells with taxol, a drug that dampens microtubule dynamics and primarily interferes
               with kinetochore tension (
               <a href="#bib46">Zachos et al., 2007</a>; 
               <a href="#bib31">Petsalaki et al., 2011</a>). However, the kinase that mediates Aurora B–S331 phosphorylation in early mitosis
               or after microtubule depolymerization by nocodazole has not been previously identified
               (

               <a href="#bib37">Schwarz et al., 2003</a>). Activated Chk2 phosphorylates cell cycle modulators, including P53 and the Cdk-activating
               phosphatases Cdc25A and Cdc25C, to induce cell cycle arrest or programmed cell death
               (
               <a href="#bib5">Chen and Poon, 2008</a>). Chk2 also phosphorylates Mps1 at threonine 288 (T288) to stabilize Mps1 protein,
               and Chk2 inhibition diminishes Mps1 levels after DNA damage through a proteasome-independent
               mechanism (
               <a href="#bib45">Yeh et al., 2009</a>). In the absence of DNA damage, Chk2 localizes to centrosomes in early mitosis (
               <a href="#bib42">Tsvetkov et al., 2003</a>) and promotes mitotic spindle assembly, proper chromosome alignment, and segregation
               through largely undescribed mechanisms (
               <a href="#bib39">Stolz et al., 2010</a>). However, a role for Chk2 in delaying anaphase onset has not been previously reported.
               In the present study, we show that Chk2 stabilizes Mps1 protein and phosphorylates
               Aurora B–S331 to prevent mitotic exit in vertebrate cells when the majority of kinetochores
               are unattached.

               <p id="d1e331">It was recently reported that loss of Chk2 function did not impair mitotic exit in
                  human HCT116 cells treated with 300 nM nocodazole (
                  <a href="#bib39">Stolz et al., 2010</a>), which appears at odds with our observations. Because we use a much higher concentration
                  of nocodazole than the one used by 
                  <a href="#bib39">Stolz et al. (2010)</a>, we examined the mitotic indices in the same cell type after treatment with relatively
                  high (3.32 µM) or low (300 nM) nocodazole. In the presence of high nocodazole, Chk2
                  inhibition reduced prometaphase accumulation in HCT116 cells by 53–80% compared with
                  controls (Fig. S1 E). In contrast, Chk2-inhibited or control cells accumulated in
                  prometaphase with similar kinetics after treatment with low nocodazole (Fig. S1 E).

               <p id="d1e339">Treatment with low nocodazole was insufficient to completely disrupt microtubule assembly
                  (Fig. S1 A). CHO cells treated with low nocodazole exhibited only 11% unattached kinetochores

                  <a href="#fig1">Fig. 1 E</a>). As a control, treatment with 1 µM taxol or 100 µM monastrol, which inhibits bipolar
                  spindle formation resulted in 6 or 33%, respectively, unattached kinetochores (

                  nocodazole, taxol, or monastrol (Fig. S1 F). We propose that Chk2 is required for

                  cells had established a prometaphase arrest in high nocodazole did not cause mitotic
                  exit (

                  anaphases with lagging chromosomes in the absence of spindle poisons (14/100) compared

                  proportion of BubR1 or Mad2 was still detectable at kinetochores in Chk2-deficient

                     (36/100) compared with controls (6/100). Also, in CHO cells, Chk2 inhibition associated
                     with increased chromosome missegregation compared with controls (Fig. S5 E). Also,

                     cells exhibited increased metaphase chromosome misalignment compared with controls

            <p id="d1e707">Chk2 is an effector of the DNA damage response in vertebrates; however, a role for
               Chk2 in delayed anaphase onset has not been previously reported. Here, we show that
               Chk2-deficient cells fail to prevent mitotic exit when microtubules are completely
               depolymerized by a high concentration of nocodazole. In contrast, Chk2 is not required
               for delayed anaphase onset when cells are treated with taxol, monastrol, or low concentration
               of nocodazole, which generate relatively few unattached kinetochores. Mitotic exit
               in Chk2-deficient cells associated with increased Cdk1-Y15 phosphorylation and reduced
               localization of BubR1 or Mad2 to kinetochores compared with controls but not with
               Cyclin B degradation. Because ∼50% of BubR1/Mad2 is still detectable at kinetochores
               in Chk2-deficient cells compared with controls, this level of BubR1/Mad2 may be sufficient
               to inhibit the APC/C and prevent Cyclin B degradation (
               <a href="#bib8">Ditchfield et al., 2003</a>). These results were unexpected because, in the presence of an active spindle checkpoint,
               mammalian cells have been shown to slip out of mitosis through gradual Cyclin B degradation
               (
               <a href="#bib4">Brito and Rieder, 2006</a>). Instead, our data show that Chk2-deficient cells exit mitosis by Cdk1-Y15 phosphorylation,
               a mechanism previously shown in yeast or human cells that lack a fully functional
               APC/C (
               <a href="#bib25">Minshull et al., 1996</a>; 
               <a href="#bib6">Chow et al., 2011</a>). We also show that Chk2-deficient cells treated with nocodazole exhibit reduced
               Mps1 protein levels compared with controls. Using T288E Mps1 resistant to degradation
               after Chk2 depletion, we propose that Chk2 prevents Cdk1-Y15 phosphorylation and mitotic
               exit by stabilizing Mps1.
               
            </p>
            <p id="d1e721">Catalytically active Chk2 localizes to kinetochores and is required for Aurora B–S331
               phosphorylation in high nocodazole or unperturbed early prometaphase. Using CHO cells
               expressing WT, S331A, or S331E Aurora B, we propose that S331 phosphorylation is required
               for prometaphase accumulation in the absence of microtubules and with reduced Mps1
               activity. This is consistent with recent studies suggesting that Aurora B is implicated
               in spindle checkpoint signaling in nocodazole when partial inhibition of checkpoint
               components presumably causes a weakened signal (
               <a href="#bib35">Santaguida et al., 2011</a>; 
               <a href="#bib23">Matson et al., 2012</a>). We also show that, in the absence of spindle drugs, Aurora B–S331 phosphorylation
               is required for optimal localization of Mps1 to kinetochores and spindle checkpoint
               establishment in early prometaphase, consistent with Mps1 activation by Aurora B at
               the onset of mitosis (
               <a href="#bib36">Saurin et al., 2011</a>). However, in late prometaphase, Chk2-deficient cells exhibit a functional spindle
               checkpoint and restored Cyclin B levels compared with controls. Although the mechanism
               of this is unknown, Cyclin B can be rapidly synthesized in mitosis through cytoplasmic
               polyadenylation element–binding protein–dependent translation (
               <a href="#bib22">Malureanu et al., 2010</a>). Chk2 depletion also reduced Mps1 protein levels but did not detectably increase
               Cdk1-Y15 phosphorylation compared with controls in unperturbed mitosis. It is possible
               that Mps1 is required to prevent Cdk1-Y15 phosphorylation after prolonged checkpoint
               activation. In addition, expression of S331E Aurora B rescues chromosome alignment
               and segregation in Chk2-deficient cells.
               
            </p>
            <p id="d1e735">On the basis of those findings, we propose the following model for the role of Chk2
               in mitosis (
               <a href="#fig8">Fig. 8 E</a>): In unperturbed early prometaphase or after treatment of cells with a high concentration
               of nocodazole, the majority of kinetochores are unattached, and Chk2 associates with
               kinetochores. Activated Chk2 stabilizes Mps1 protein levels, possibly through phosphorylating
               Mps1-T288 and inhibits Cdk1-Y15 phosphorylation through an Mps1-dependent mechanism
               to prevent mitotic exit after prolonged checkpoint activation. Furthermore, Chk2 phosphorylates
               Aurora B–S331 to induce Aurora B kinase activity, and this phosphorylation is required
               for optimal localization of Mps1 and Mad2 to kinetochores and inactivation of the
               APC/C at the beginning of mitosis. In addition, Chk2 promotes proper chromosome alignment
               through Aurora B–S331 phosphorylation. Later in prometaphase, cells progressively
               form kinetochore–microtubule attachments, and Chk2 dissociates from kinetochores and
               is dispensable for Aurora B–S331 phosphorylation and spindle checkpoint establishment.
               As a result, Chk2-deficient cells exit mitosis upon activation of the APC/C but exhibit
               increased frequency of chromosome missegregation. Our model raises several important
               questions regarding the molecular mechanism of Cdk1-Y15 phosphorylation, the mechanism
               of Chk2 activation in mitosis, and the significance of Chk2 signaling for error correction.
               
            </p>
            <p id="d1e740">In interphase cells, Cdk1-Y15 phosphorylation is imposed by the Wee1 and Myt1 kinases
               and requires Cdk1 in complex with Cyclin B (
               <a href="#bib24">McGowan and Russell, 1993</a>; 
               <a href="#bib27">Mueller et al., 1995b</a>). Potent inhibition of Mps1 inactivates the spindle checkpoint, forcing cells to
               exit mitosis through Cyclin B degradation (

               <a href="#bib20">Maciejowski et al., 2010</a>). However, the fact that a Cyclin B–Cdk1 complex is present in Chk2-deficient cells
               could provide substrates for Wee1 and Myt1 kinases to impose the Cdk1-Y15 phosphorylation
               (
               <a href="#bib24">McGowan and Russell, 1993</a>; 
               <a href="#bib27">Mueller et al., 1995b</a>). Because activation of Wee1/Myt1 requires removal of their inhibitory phosphorylation
               (
               <a href="#bib40">Tang et al., 1993</a>; 
               <a href="#bib26">Mueller et al., 1995a</a>), one possibility is that reduced BubR1/Mad2 binding to kinetochores in Chk2-deficient
               cells can lead to a slight reduction of Cdk1 activity perhaps by a small fraction
               of active APC/C, which in turn is sufficient to turn on some Wee1/Myt1 and start the
               Cdk1-Wee1/Myt1 feedback loop. Alternatively, a Wee1/Myt1 stimulatory phosphatase that
               removes the inhibitory phosphorylation of Wee1/Myt1 may become activated in Chk2-deficient
               cells (

               <a href="#bib3">Ahn et al., 2002</a>). However, we show that Chk2 is activated in the absence of T68 phosphorylation in
               mitotic cells, in agreement with a previous study (
               <a href="#bib44">van Vugt et al., 2010</a>). Because Chk2 overexpression can promote oligomerization and cis- and trans-phosphorylation
               of regulatory residues (

               <a href="#bib37">Schwarz et al., 2003</a>), one possibility is that local enrichment of Chk2 at kinetochores facilitates Chk2
               oligomerization and activation without T68 phosphorylation. This mechanism may contribute
               to spatial regulation of Chk2-dependent processes in mitosis.

               reflect different phases of mitosis in which Chk1 and Chk2 are activated. A similar
               division of labor occurs in the G2 DNA damage checkpoint: Chk1 prevents G2 cells with
               damaged DNA from entering mitosis, whereas Chk2 is solely responsible for mitotic
               delay in late G2 cells, which are imminently about to enter mitosis (

               they can delay anaphase to correct many kinetochore misattachments. This may explain
               how Chk2-deficient cells apparently segregate the majority of their chromosomes correctly
               and is consistent with increased duration of unperturbed prometaphase and metaphase
               in those cells (
               <a href="#bib39">Stolz et al., 2010</a>). However, because some erroneous (merotelic) attachments can evade detection from
               the spindle checkpoint (
               <a href="#bib7">Cimini, 2008</a>), Chk2-deficient cells can enter anaphase with higher frequency of lagging chromosomes
               compared with controls. Further experiments are under way to understand the role of
               Chk2 in error correction.

                  or CHO cells after treatment with Chk2 inhibitor II, and human Mps1 kinase activity
                  in the presence of various concentrations of the Mps1 inhibitor AZ3146. Fig. S2 shows
                  that Chk2-deficient cells exhibit Cdk1-Y15 phosphorylation and Mps1 degradation in
                  high nocodazole. Fig. S3 shows Chk2-pT383 staining in unperturbed prophase, Aurora
                  B–S331 phosphorylation in cells treated with taxol or low nocodazole, Myc–Aurora B
                  expression levels, Myc-associated catalytic activity in CHO cell lines, and CHO Mps1
                  kinase activity in the presence of various concentrations of AZ3146. Fig. S4 shows
                  that Chk2 inhibition reduces Mps1 localization to kinetochores in high nocodazole.
                  Fig. S5 shows that Chk2 is dispensable for Mad2 localization to kinetochores in unperturbed
                  late prometaphase. Video 1 shows control cells arrested in mitosis in the presence
                  of high nocodazole. Video 2 shows Chk2-deficient cells decondensing their chromosomes
                  and forming micronuclei in the presence of high nocodazole. Online supplemental material
